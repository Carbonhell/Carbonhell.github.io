This is a collection of tools, frameworks, programming languages, and services that I keep in my toolbox.

The format of this page follows a simplified setup based on [Thoughtworks' technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).
Technologies I consider on hold are simply not present. They might be mentioned in the sections of alternatives that are present, such as TypeScript being my go-to choice over JavaScript in pretty much any non-trivial case.

Entries under "Assess" are ones I am keeping my eye on without planning on trying out in the short term.

"Trial" lists technologies I plan to try out in the short term.

"Adopt" showcases my actual toolbox: technologies I rely on if I have full freedom when choosing a particular problem suited for them.

{{ note(header="Under construction", body="Several technologies are still missing. I'll add them in the following days.") }}
