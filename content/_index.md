I'm Francesco, a software engineer from Italy 🇮🇹 currently employed as a DevOps engineer in a B2B newspace startup.

My technical interests span from any layer of the software stack: embedded, cloud, backend, cybersecurity, you name it, I am most likely interested in it - bonus points if it involves Rust :)

There are some exceptions:
- Frontend: I like the technical challenges behind a well-made web app or mobile app, but I tend to waste too much time on tiny details, and I don't have a well-developed taste for UI/UX.
- AI/ML: I like products in those areas as a user, but I dislike the black box concept as a developer.

In general, I'm interested in startups, space, gaming and the open source ecosystem.

I have several goals behind the making of this blog.

I want to improve my writing and presentation skills, along with how I explain concepts.

I also want to be able to share and remember interesting links I find on Hackernews or when falling into a rabbit hole while deep diving on random ideas I think of.

Lastly, I don't have a good memory, and I want to write down things I learn that I deem useful for my future self.

I hope you find some of the content here useful for you. Happy diving!
