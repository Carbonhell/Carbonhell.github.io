This is a collection of tools, frameworks and programming languages I've used in the past which I resort to during my software engineering activities.

This does not include technologies I had a bad experience and which I would prefer to avoid.

# Programming languages
- Rust: my main default, unless I need to work on something with a team more experienced in another language which also makes sense for the problem at hand.
- Python: my second default, which I prioritize if my team has more experience with it and for prototyping.
- PHP: what I used in previous jobs for web apps, admin panels and web APIs.
